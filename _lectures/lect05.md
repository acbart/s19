# Lesson plan

In this session experienced tutors from multiple LD courses are invited to observe their peers tutoring and provide  feedback. 

Prior to the class 190J students submit the hardest questions that they had to answer over the course of the program. If the questions were related to debugging, they should also submit the buggy student code that pertains to the question.

The instructor collects all submissions and redacts any student-speicfic information from the code and stores them in a git repo organized per course. For each course the questions are organized in directories that are numbered from 1 to 5.

In class, students will practice tutoring in multiple short sessions. At the end of each session, all participants write short reflections.


## Getting set up 

* Form groups of 4 
* One experienced tutor leads each group 
* Clone the git repo that contains the practice code on your laptop or on CSIL

## What happens in each round (5 to 10 minutes, 40 minutes)

* One person assumes the role of a student seeking help, another that of a tutor. The others including the lead tutors are observers.
* The student should start by asking a question about the problematic code. The tutor should appropriately guide them to debug it
* Each interaction should not exceed 10 minutes. If the interaction ends in less than 5 minutes, the student should proceed to ask a second question.

### Reflections and feedback (5 minutes, 20 minutes total)

* After each tutoring session, all the observers (including the lead tutor) should fill this form about the interaction [peer-review observation form](http://bit.ly/Peer-observation-form)

* The student who assumed the role of a "tutor" should fill this reflection form: [190J-tutor reflection form](http://bit.ly/190J-tutor-reflection-form) 

* The lead tutors go over the feedback in the observation form and summarize the feedback for the tutor
