# Lesson plan

Experienced tutors from multiple LD courses are invited to observe their peers tutoring to provide appropriate feedback. 

Prior to the class 190J students submit the hardest questions  that students have asked them so far related to concepts and code. Students should submit buggy student-code that they were asked help with prior to the class.

The instructor collects all submissions and redacts any student-specific information from the code. The sample code is organized in a git repo.

In class, students will practice tutoring in mini mock tutoring sessions. At the end of each session, all participants write short reflections.

## Getting set up ( 5 minutes)

* Form groups of 4 
* One experienced tutor leads each group 
* Clone the git repo that contains the practice code on your laptop or on CSIL

## About the activity (5 to 10 minutes per student, 40 minutes)

* One person assumes the role of a student seeking help, another that of a tutor. The others including the lead tutors are observers.
* The student should start by asking a question about the problematic code. The tutor should appropriately guide them to debug it
* Each interaction should not exceed 10 minutes. If the interaction ends in less than 5 minutes, the student should proceed to ask a second question.

### Reflections and feedback (5 minutes per student, 20 minutes total)

* After each tutoring session, all the observers (including the lead tutor) should fill this form about the interaction [peer-review observation form](http://bit.ly/Peer-observation-form)

* The student who assumed the role of a "tutor" should fill this reflection form: [190J-tutor reflection form](http://bit.ly/190J-tutor-reflection-form) 

* The lead tutors go over the feedback in the observation form and summarize the feedback for the tutor
