<b>READING ASSIGNMENT</b>

# Lightning talks

Prepare a 3-5 minute talk about the research paper that you read and summarized in h02. Your talk should summarize the key contributions and main takeaways of the paper. Also comment on what aspects of the work would be interesting to incorporate in our current tutor program. You may use a few slides for your presentation or none at all. Open the floor for questions after your talk.

While you are not presenting, attend carefully to whoever is talking and ask relevant questions. The lightning talks will be conducted over two lectures as per the following assignment:
